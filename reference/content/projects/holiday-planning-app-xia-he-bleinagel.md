**Xia He-Bleinagel** (Head of Data & Cloud) built a comprehensive **holiday planning app** to replace endless Excel sheets for managing team holidays.

The app is built on **Django** and uses a mix of AI tools in the workflow:

- **ChatGPT**: to refine prompts (e.g. by uploading a design mock and improving instructions)
- **Lovable**: to create the UI and frontend (cleaner output than Cursor for design)
- **Cursor**: for implementation (ran into repeated bugs, fixed 6–7 times)
- **Google Antigravity (Gemini 3 Pro)**: solved the remaining bug on the first attempt, with clear error explanations and step-by-step implementation help (strongest overall experience in her testing)

**Features:** Supabase Postgres, secure authentication with admin-invited users, different UI and permissions per role, and integrated **school holidays** and **German national holidays**. No more static spreadsheets per year.
