Project from the first cohort of the [AI Engineering Buildcamp](https://maven.com/alexey-grigorev/from-rag-to-agents), by **Asia Amodeo**.

The agent integrates with the **Gmail API** to fetch emails and indexes them in **Elasticsearch**. It features a chat interface built with **Streamlit**, where you can ask questions to find specific emails or see what is important for the day. While it currently focuses on fetching and reading, the concept addresses "email fatigue" by making it easier to sift through communication.

**Tech stack:** Gmail API, Elasticsearch, Streamlit.
