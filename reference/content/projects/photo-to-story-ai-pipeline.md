title: "Photo-to-Story AI Pipeline"
description: "A small, self-contained project idea: take a photo of an everyday object and turn it into a short story with AI. Expand gradually with illustration, audio, a small website, and a podcast feed. Great for experimenting with multimodal pipelines (vision, text, speech) and sharing with kids, family, or friends."

A fun, holiday-friendly project to try in a week: build a **photo-to-story** AI pipeline.

**Start simple:** take a photo of an everyday object and use an AI model to generate a short story from it. From there, you can expand step by step:

- Add an **illustration** (image generation from the story or the photo)
- Generate **audio** (text-to-speech)
- Publish on a **small website**
- Share as a **podcast feed** (RSS)

You can also explore other directions: text-to-text variations, speech-to-text, or different output formats. Use your creativity: it's a practical way to experiment with **multimodal** projects (vision, text, and speech) in one pipeline.

Alexey built a full version of this idea: [Kids Horror Stories](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/kids-horror-stories-ru). Photo in, story + illustration + narration out, published on the web and as a Spotify podcast. You can read the architecture and implementation in the blog post below.
