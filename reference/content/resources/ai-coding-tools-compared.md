In this workshop, Alexey Grigorev explores the rapidly growing ecosystem of AI-assisted development tools: from conversational coding apps to full-fledged autonomous agents. Through a series of live demos, he compares tools like ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Lovable, showing how each fits into a modern developer workflow and where the new generation of AI agents is heading.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop provides a comprehensive comparison of today's most popular AI coding tools through hands-on demonstrations. You'll see each tool in action, understand their strengths and limitations, and learn when to use each type of tool in your development workflow.

## What You'll Learn

- **Chat-Based Assistants**: How ChatGPT and Claude compare for coding tasks
- **IDE Integration**: Using GitHub Copilot and Cursor for real-time assistance
- **Project Bootstrapping**: Tools like Lovable and claude-code CLI for rapid prototyping
- **AI Agents**: Understanding autonomous agents and computer-use capabilities
- **Tool Selection**: When to use each type of tool for different tasks
- **Limitations**: Common pitfalls and how to work around them

## Core Tools Demonstrated

### Chat Applications
- **ChatGPT**: Code generation and instructions
- **Claude.ai**: Coding and debugging capabilities

### Integrated Coding Assistants
- **GitHub Copilot**: Real-time code suggestions in VS Code
- **Cursor**: AI-enhanced VS Code fork with advanced features

### Project Bootstrappers
- **Lovable**: Instant web project prototyping
- **claude-code CLI**: Command-line project scaffolding

### AI Agents
- **Anthropic Computer-Use Agent**: Autonomous desktop control and task execution

## Workshop Structure

### Part 1: Tool Categories
Understanding the four main categories of AI-assisted development tools:
- Chat apps
- Coding assistants
- Project bootstrappers
- Agents

### Part 2: Chat-Based Tools
Live demos comparing ChatGPT and Claude for coding tasks, including:
- Generating a Snake game with React
- Getting setup instructions
- Handling outdated responses and legacy issues

### Part 3: IDE Integration
Exploring tools that work inside your development environment:
- GitHub Copilot for real-time suggestions
- Cursor IDE for AI-powered development
- Refactoring and code improvement workflows

### Part 4: Project Bootstrapping
Tools for quickly starting new projects:
- Lovable for instant web prototypes
- claude-code CLI for command-line scaffolding

### Part 5: Autonomous Agents

- Anthropic's computer-use agent
- Real desktop control and task execution
- Web search and autonomous actions

## Key Comparisons

### ChatGPT vs Claude
- **ChatGPT**: Good for code generation, may have outdated information
- **Claude**: Strong debugging capabilities, better at understanding context

### Copilot vs Cursor
- **Copilot**: Real-time suggestions, integrated with VS Code
- **Cursor**: Full IDE replacement with advanced AI features

### Lovable vs claude-code CLI
- **Lovable**: Visual, instant web project creation
- **claude-code CLI**: Command-line tool for project scaffolding

## Common Limitations

- **Outdated Information**: LLMs may provide legacy setup instructions
- **Context Limits**: Some tools struggle with large codebases
- **Debugging**: Not all tools handle complex debugging scenarios equally
- **Project Structure**: Understanding when to use bootstrappers vs building from scratch

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this workshop, you'll have:
- Clear understanding of each tool category and when to use them
- Hands-on experience with multiple AI coding tools
- Knowledge of strengths and limitations of each tool
- Understanding of where AI agents are heading
- Awareness of upcoming learning opportunities

## Prerequisites
