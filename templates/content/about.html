              <p>
                Software engineer and machine learning practitioner with 15+ years of experience building production ML systems.
                I focus on practical, production-grade ML and AI systems, from early prototypes to reliable systems in production.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm the founder of DataTalks.Club, a free community that connects tens of thousands
                of practitioners worldwide, and the creator of the Zoomcamp series, free, code-first
                programs that have reached 100,000+ learners globally.
              </p>
              <p>
                At AI Shipping Labs, I'm building the kind of environment that would have accelerated my own career growth.
                After years of teaching at scale, I wanted something more focused: a space for action-oriented builders who
                want to turn AI ideas into real projects. The community gives members the structure, accountability, and peer
                support to ship practical AI products consistently, even alongside their main jobs.

              <p>
                Content strategist and technical writer specializing in AI/ML education. I focus on making complex
                technical concepts accessible and helping builders learn through clear, practical content.
              </p>
              <p>
                At AI Shipping Labs, I work alongside Alexey to shape the community's content strategy and member experience.
                I ensure that motivated learners have the resources, frameworks, and clear direction they need to make
                consistent progress on their AI projects. My goal is to help builders bridge the gap from ideas to
                shipped products by providing structure and removing friction from the learning-by-doing process.
